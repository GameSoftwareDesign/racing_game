# Lego Racers: Remake++
An attempt to remake my childhood favourite Lego Racers, with added features, including intelligent enemies, powerups and obstacles.

## Competitive Analysis
The first racing game to analyse will of course be **Lego Racers** itself. This will naturally be a hard game to beat in terms of playability, mechanics and features. However, this remake++ version will not only incorporate the good parts of Lego Racers, but also add-on some features:

## Structural Plan
A structural plan for how the finalized project will be organized in different functions, files and/or objects.

## Algorithmic Plan
A detailed algorithmic plan for how you will approach the trickiest part of the project.

## Timeline Plan
A timeline for when you intend to complete the major features of the project.

## Version Control Plan
This [Github repository](https://github.com/Samleo8/112LegoRacers) controls both the code versions, as well as the structure and timeline of the project *(see [Projects](https://github.com/Samleo8/112LegoRacers/projects) and [Issues](https://github.com/Samleo8/112LegoRacers/issues))*. 

Commits automatically reference and close their associated issues.
