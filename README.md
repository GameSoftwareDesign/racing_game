# CMU 15-112 Term Project: Lego Racers

Semi-recreation of my childhood favourite, Lego Racers, for my CMU 15-112 Term Project!
Includes intelligent enemies, powerups and obstacles!

## Running and Installation
First clone the git repository.

Then install all requirements by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The crucial library used for this game is the [Panda3D Engine](https://www.panda3d.org).

Then, run the game with `python Game.py`. Note that only Python 3 is supported.
